# TriviaGame
This is a basic trivia game using js and jQuery.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML, CSS, javascript, jquery, BootStrap 4, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome.

GENERAL COMMENTS: I've added a progress bar that tracks the number of questions completed.

CHALLENGES: My initial challenge was how to store the questions. Having a better understanding of objects in javascript
I decided to put the questions in a basic javascript object.
